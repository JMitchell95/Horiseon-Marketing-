Home Work Notes

HTML 


Line 12: Contains Header.. class defines seo as own element but is never used in CSS( probably delete isnce its jsut extra and header can be grouped)

Line 14 -24 Contains Links on webpage with list tags... see if theres a way to sonsolidate so it doesnt use multiple Lists 

Line 27 Hero Class contains Visual Elements for Header image

Line 30 has weird float left even though its contianed within a class... unnecessary code

Line 36 both and ID cand Class are created for the same element... Fix that

Line 37 same as 30

Line 43  same as 36 fix 

Line 44 same as above fix

Line 51 -52 Wh are there two classes yeet that shit
(titled benefits but Header is LEad generation overall confusing in comparion to live page)

CSS


NGL I cant even go through this CSS at the time fo wriing this but all in all fonts are missing proper syntax to work on the page

different falues arent correctly typed andd otheriwsie do nothing

too amny redudnant elemnts that can be cleaned up

Overall goal Condense the CSS and comment each tag to explaine xactly what and hopw it does what it needs to do
